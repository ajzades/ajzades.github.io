      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p> 
        Hi! Thanks for checking out my website! If this actually works, then I must say, I'm pretty proud of myself. A little bit about me is that I am a senior at MSU Denver getting my bachelor's in Geography and Sustainability. I'm also getting my minor in GIS which would explain why I'm in a web mapping class!
        Aside from taking classes and studying, I really enjoy being outdoors. My primary hobbies are hiking, biking and rock climbing. Winter is a big bummer for me beacause I'm pretty much locked inside. I know what everyone is thinking, "Lexi, you live in Colorado but don't ski?" I hear this every winter.
        Honestly, no, I have no desire to be freezing cold and soaking wet. It's just not for me. The one time I tried to embrace the winter and ski, I was kicked off the mountain because of how bad I was. I kid you not, the ski patrol told me I was a hazard to myself and others. So, In the winter I basically stay indoors and cook my way through Top Chef and British Bake Off.

      <h2> Why GIS?</h2>
      <p> 
        Well, what a great question. I guess my respone would be, why not! As someone who loves the outdoors (except for winter, as we now know) I couldn't think of a better field for myself. <br> Upon taking my first introduction course, I really felt like I finally found a career path that I am interested in. My natural curiosity led me to a major in geography and my love for nature and desire to preserve it is what brought me to sustainability, but GIS is something else all together. <br> To be frank, I didn't know what GIS was just two years ago. The words raster and vector were foreign to me. That being said, in just two short years I have really felt my skills and knowledge develop. <br> My favorite part about GIS is all the learning involved. I mean, last week I didn't know the first thing about coding, and now I'm building a website...WHAT! How cool!? GIS has really opened another door into my brain that I didn't know existed. So I guess, that's why GIS!

      <h3> A recipe inspired by British Bake Off: <i>Shortbread Biscuits</i> </h3>
      <p> As we know, I don't ski and I hate winter. So what better way to embrace this upcoming holiday season, than a recipe from me to you.

        <li>125g salted butter </li>
        <li>55g caster sugar </li>

      <h4>steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and mix until combined. Add the flour and pulse briefly until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Tip out the mixture onto a work surface and gently bring it together, then knead it into a dough. Once the dough is formed, wrap it in cling film and chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees <sup>f</sup></li>
        <li>Once the dough has chilled, lightly flour the work surface and roll out the dough until it is about the thickness of a penny. Use cookie cutters to stamp out cookies.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the biscuits with a little caster sugar and bake for 10â€“12 minutes, or until lightly golden. </li>
        <li>Let the cookies cool for ten minutes on the baking sheet then move to a cooling rack. Eat!
